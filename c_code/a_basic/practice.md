`A reason for brick walls`

``` shall
Brick walls are there for a reason. 
The brick walls aren't there to `keep us out`. 
The brick walls are there to show us how badly we want things. 
```

`We all want to be in love`

``` shall
We all want to be in love and find that person no matter how our feet smell, no matter how angry we get one day, no matter the things we say that we don't mean.
```
